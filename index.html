(Strated corporate life in Bangalore performing analytics for retail, technology and e-commerce then moved to Mumbai joining JP Morgan, to settle closer home.But then Shivani came in life and had to follow her down to Bangalore and settled here for now.Loves Cooking (not more than eating though!) and it comes naturally to Piyush as he is cooking since 6th standard. Adept at cooking any north indian dish specially daal baati..Believe it or not, this was the major reason for Shivani's "Yes I do" </p>

                            <p>In late 2015, the bride's and groom's fathers met in a social gathering and became good friends. Like any other arranged marrige in Indian society, they discussed on the possibilities of their kids getting together. Their parents discussed the same with both of them and within few days the family met in Ujjain. The couple did not get chance to talk much. Piyush asked Shivani to meet the next weekend in Bangalore. At that time he worked in Mumbai. Shivani suggested that knowing each other is a better option before planning a long travel. And then it all started. They did talk! a lot !! After two weeks they met on a day after Piyush's birthday which also happened to be Valentines day(coincidently). By that time they both knew each other pretty well and got along very nicely... and that's where the whole story began</p>

                            <p>
                                Ujjain is the fifth largest city in Madhya Pradesh by population. An ancient city situated on the eastern bank of the Kshipra River, Ujjain was the most prominent city on the Malwa plateau of central India for much of its history. It emerged as the political centre of central India around 600 BCE. It remained an important political, commercial and cultural centre of central India until the early 19th century, when the British administrators decided to develop Indore as an alternative to it. Ujjain continues to be an important place of pilgrimage for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and followers of Shakta.
